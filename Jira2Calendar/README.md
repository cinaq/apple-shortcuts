# Jira2Calendar

When the deadline attribute is set in a Jira issue, the issue is added to a Calendar. The calendar event is created if it does not exist.

Call `Jira2Calendar` with the format: `JiraCloudName;CalendarName`. JiraCloudName is used to construct the URL to jira issues in the calendar event.
